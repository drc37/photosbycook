h1. smugmugr

A (he's the DJ, I'm the) wrapper for v1.2.2 of the SmugMug "JSON API":http://wiki.smugmug.net/display/API/API+1.2.2.

Originally inspired by Scott White's simple_smugmug Rails plugin:
http://github.com/scottwhite/simple_smugmug/tree/master

Current version: 0.2.0

h2. Roadmap

h3. v1.0

  * read-only (with and without login (password-based and OAuth)) bits

h3. v2.0

  * read-write

h2. Usage

The current highly opinionated way to use this gem is:

user = Smugmugr::User.new(api_key, :email => 'foo@example.com', :password => 'secret')
albums = user.albums
images = albums.first.images

As of v1.2.2 of the API, Smugmug allows the passing of an Extras parameter to allow customization of a call to your liking:

"http://www.dgrin.com/showthread.php?t=90636":http://www.dgrin.com/showthread.php?t=90636

Taking advantage of this is a cinch with smugmugr:

albums = user.albums(:SmugSearchable,:LastUpdated,:ImageCount)

will yield:

albums.first.extras => {:ImageCount=>29, :LastUpdated=>"2009-05-16 15:23:11", :SmugSearchable=>true}

Also:

albums.first.last_updated => "2009-05-16 15:23:11"
albums.first.LastUpdated => "2009-05-16 15:23:11"

albums.first.image_count => 29
albums.first.ImageCount => 29

h3. TODO
  * TESTS: added rspec requires and shell spec classes.
  * TBD
